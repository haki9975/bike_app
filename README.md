Hello! Welcome to the bike maintenance tracker. 

With this app you are able to create bikes and maintenance records in a database. This will be helpful for tracking how much you spent on each bike, and when the last time you completed a particular service was! 

First, you must sign up with an email and password. You'll be directed to a home page that lists all of your bikes. From there, you will need to use our friendly drop down menu to create your bike profiles before you start creating the service records for each of your bikes. 

Of course, you can create as many bikes as you like and the same goes for the maintenance records too! You are able to view and edit all of the information that you entered should you wish to make a change. Lastly, should you sell a bike you are able to either keep your records to look back on or delete them all together! 

One thing to note, if you delete a bike all of the records for that bicycle will be deleted as well. 

Thank you and enjoy!
